After 2 seconds, he also becomes camouflaged and gains Unseen Predator for the remaining duration. His next basic attack within normal attack range against any enemy unit or against the nearest enemy champion deals 50% bonus physical damage and reduces the target's armor for 4 seconds. The nearest enemy champion to Rengar alerts all of their allies within 1200 range about his presence, and they can sense him at 1600 range. Attacking or casting abilities, though not Savagery, ends Thrill of the Hunt immediately.",
